 abstractNote={The rapid growth of the ride-hailing industry has revolutionized urban transportation worldwide. Despite its benefits, equity concerns arise as underserved communities face limited accessibility to affordable ride-hailing services. A key issue in this context is the vehicle rebalancing problem, where idle vehicles are moved to areas with anticipated demand. Without equitable approaches in demand forecasting and rebalancing strategies, these practices can further deepen existing inequities. In the realm of ride-hailing, three main facets of fairness are recognized: algorithmic fairness, fairness to drivers, and fairness to riders. This paper focuses on enhancing both algorithmic and rider fairness through a novel vehicle rebalancing method. We introduce an approach that combines a Socio-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SA-STGCN) for refined demand prediction and a fairnessintegrated Matching-Integrated Vehicle Rebalancing (MIVR) model for subsequent vehicle rebalancing. Our methodology is designed to reduce prediction discrepancies and ensure equitable service provision across diverse regions. The effectiveness of our system is evaluated using simulations based on real-world ride-hailing data. The results suggest that our proposed method enhances both accuracy and fairness in forecasting ride-hailing demand, ultimately resulting in more equitable vehicle rebalancing in subsequent operations. Specifically, the algorithm developed in this study effectively reduces the standard deviation and average customer wait times by 6.48% and 0.49%, respectively. This achievement signifies a beneficial outcome for ride-hailing platforms, striking a balance between operational efficiency and fairness.},

 title={Large Language Models for Travel Behavior Prediction},

 abstractNote={Travel behavior prediction is a fundamental task in transportation demand management. The conventional methods for travel behavior prediction rely on numerical data to construct mathematical models and calibrate model parameters to represent human preferences. Recent advancement in large language models (LLMs) has shown great reasoning abilities to solve complex problems. In this study, we propose to use LLMs to predict travel behavior with prompt engineering without data-based parameter learning. Specifically, we carefully design our prompts that include 1) task description, 2) travel characteristics, 3) individual attributes, and 4) guides of thinking with domain knowledge, and ask the LLMs to predict an individualâ€™s travel behavior and explain the results. We select the travel mode choice task as a case study. Results show that, though no training samples are provided, LLM-based predictions have competitive accuracy and F1-score as canonical supervised learning methods such as multinomial logit, random forest, and neural networks. LLMs can also output reasons that support their prediction. However, though in most of the cases, the output explanations are reasonable, we still observe cases that violate logic or with hallucinations.},
